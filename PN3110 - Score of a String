"""
Here we have used here two function here -
1. ord() 2. abs()

1. ord() - ord() function in python is a built-in function that is used to return an integer representing the Unicode code point of a specified character.
           Here we have use it ord() beacause we want ASCII value of character.

2. abs() - abs() is used to get the absoulute value that is always positive. we use it to get positive value wheather the value is negative or positive.
